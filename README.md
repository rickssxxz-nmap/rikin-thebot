As part of my HexSoftwares Artificial Intelligence Internship – Task 1

💡 “Just built my own AI-powered Virtual Agent named "rikin"that can handle inquiries, share product info, and provide support 🚀”

 ✅ Leveraged Zapier’s AI Chatbot to design a virtual agent.
 ✅ Trained it with custom knowledge base + FAQs.
 ✅ Added smart flows so it can assist users 24/7.
 ✅ Deployable across websites, social media, and messaging apps.

 This project shows how businesses can reduce support workload, improve customer engagement, and provide instant answers using no-code AI tools.
